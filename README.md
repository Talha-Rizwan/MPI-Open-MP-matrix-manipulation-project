# MPI-Open-MP-matrix-manipulation-project

a) Find the optimal order of multiplying the matrices by calculating the scalar multiplications.
b) After finding the optimal order, multiply the matrices through blocking and non-blocking
calls. The blocking code can be found here for your help

c) Then multiply same matrices by Strassens matrix multiplication method through blocking
calls.
